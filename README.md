# Wardrobe
Week 6 Project

1. Created four tables for each clothing type with a couple fields specific to that type.
2. Created outfit table to pull each clothing item into a single view. 
3. Created Index page for each clothing type showing thumbnails that link to details view.
4. Details view provide links to edit or delete item.
5. Outfits table allows choosing of one of each item. 
6. Outfits index is a list of outfits created. 
7. Outfits Details page show grid of four clothing pieces and links to details for each piece.
8. Used shared layout views to standardize views of Index, Details, Edit and Delete pages. 


ISSUES:
1. could not added accessories due to error EntityValidationErrors in controller. 
2. could not create outfits without accessories even though it was nullable.
